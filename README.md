# Theoretical-Control-System-Problem
A course project for **Automatic Control Systems III** covering modeling, analysis, and simulation of linear and nonlinear systems. Part A studies a closed-loop plant (H(s)=K/(s(Ts+1))), derives the characteristic equation and step/ramp behavior (including the ramp steady-state error), and analyzes performance.  The report also uses Lyapunov methods to estimate a (ellipsoidal) region of attraction via the Lyapunov equation and matrix (P).  In Part B, it designs state-feedback and examines robustness to a nonlinear term (g(x)), plus an adaptive law with LaSalle’s invariance principle.   

Despite receiving a low grade from the professor, I believe the work shows solid reasoning, clear simulations, and useful takeaways—so I’m sharing it here anyway.
